# My Config Files

These are the config files I use on my system.

I use them by cloning this repository and creating symlinks to the files in it
in the appropriate locations. Subdirectories have README files that may have
additional info about how to set up that config.

Originally I created this repo to host my user config files (dotfiles) from my
home directory, but now it is also for my system configs from `/etc` and my
kernel config.
